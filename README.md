# CarClassifier-CNN
This repository contains a Python Program which can classify between SUVs and Sedans.

For this , I used the Keras module which can be used to build CNN models.

This repository also contains a screenshot of the accuracy I got on my PC.

For training the CNN model , I gathered a dataset of images of SUVs and Sedans.

This dataset will be uploaded in two separate repositories (SUV IMAGES , SEDAN IMAGES)
